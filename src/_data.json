These living code samples are self-documenting style guides that extend to accommodate a client’s needs as well as the needs of the ever-evolving multi-device web.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since then, I have been borrowing/stealing pieces of code and conventions from a multitude of frameworks and blog posts. It is only recently that I began compiling and keeping a collection of the best of these frameworks. I&#39;ve also learned a lot from <a href=\"http://basscss.com/\">BassCSS</a> and <a href=\"http://tachyons.io/\">Tachyons</a> and I may have just duplicated their efforts. However, the best way to learn is to build things, and here is my ongoing effort to build something useful for myself. I&#39;ve also borrowed code from <a href=\"http://getskeleton.com/\">Skeleton</a>, whose simplicity I&#39;ve loved for many years.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ve made a few decisions that I think are important to keep in mind:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No CSS pre/post processors (more on this later)</li>\n<li>No prefixes. These can be added a variety of ways in your build process.</li>\n<li>No JavasScript. Any JavaScript fanciness is up to you.</li>\n</ol>\n","updatedAt":"2017-12-30T00:37:08.428Z"}}
